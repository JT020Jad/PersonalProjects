                        <p> My name is Mohammad Touihri. I am a 2nd Year Computer Science student in DT228 (TU856) in TU Dublin. This website was made for a Web Development
                            assignment in which we were tasked with creating a Library webpage that contains SQL, PHP, HTML and CSS. 
                            <br>
                            This is my attempt at fulfilling the requirements of the task in hand. The site has taken me quite some time to complete due to the many various aspects 
                            included in the assignment task sheet
